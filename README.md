# MNIST From Scratch [WIP]

Project to create a neural network to classify handwritten digits from MNIST from scratch. There are no proper machine learning frameworks used, so the model network, data processing, and the backpropagation calculus are all written by me.

TODO:
- [x] Data loading
- [x] Base model
- [x] Backpropagation
- [x] Training loop
- [ ] Finetuning
